## By  Me 

I am currently a senior student at Internet and   student  at  University of Rwanda. I am good at learning programming languages (not natural languages as I use google translate, I can work anywhere in world where google translate works).  I love  codes, comics,  and movies. I feel more exprienced with javascript than python(Githubs stats) but I like python because of Artifial intelligence. I am open to work wether intership or part-time job.
